# Embedded-C
Codes in this project were written by me during Ele 362 course (Introduction to Microcontrollers and Basic Architecture, Embedded C Language, Arithmetic and Logical Operations, General-Purpose Input/Output Ports, Machine Cycle, Timer, Pulse Width Modulation, Interrupting Service Routine (ISR), Controller Area Network (CAN), Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI), Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter (UART), Power Control, Real-Time Clock, ADC and DAC Programming.) during 2023-2024 Spring semester. 

I wrote those code examples during labs. I used STM32CubeMx, Keil uVision5 and a boot program for microcontroller. I used stm32f415rgt6 model during labs.
